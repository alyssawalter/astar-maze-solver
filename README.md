# astar-maze-solver
This program implements the A* search algorithm to solve a maze. The maze is represented as a grid where each cell can either be empty (0), a wall (1), an exit (2), visited (3), or part of the solution path (4). The program uses the Manhattan distance as the heuristic to guide the search.
